Fill in the blanks 

My name is James. I love Danganronpa and Joyce and my few friends! I am a fan of many things including learning applied mathematics, running, reading, and sleeping. I am always hungry and on the prowl for someone's pantry and I crawl like a cat when nobody watches. I am terrible at programming and terrible at making relationships. Just trying out GitHub for fun and for CS1100.
